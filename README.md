DRISHTI: Intelligent Safety Stick for the Visually Impaired

Project DRISHTI (‡§¶‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø‡§É Vision) is an open-source, smart electronic travel aid designed to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. It acts as an intelligent guardian by integrating multiple sensors to provide real-time environmental awareness and an automated emergency alert system.

This project addresses the key limitations of traditional aids, which cannot detect head-level obstacles or ground-level hazards like puddles. It also tackles the critical challenge of summoning help quickly after a fall and the economic inaccessibility of commercial smart canes, which can cost from ‚Çπ15,000 to over ‚Çπ50,000. By leveraging an ESP32 microcontroller and common components, DRISHTI offers a powerful, low-cost, and reliable safety device.

‚ú® Key Features
Proactive Obstacle Detection: An ultrasonic sensor detects forward obstacles within a 1 m range. When an obstacle is detected, it provides a 2-second haptic (vibration) warning to the user.

Automated Fall Detection: An integrated MPU-6050 accelerometer accurately detects the unique G-force signature associated with a user fall.

Multi-Stage SOS System: Upon detecting a fall, a dual-alert system is immediately activated:

Local Alarm: A loud, continuous buzzer sounds to alert people in the immediate vicinity for help.

Remote Alert: Simultaneously, a signal is sent via Bluetooth LE to a companion smartphone app. The app then automatically sends a pre-written emergency SMS to a designated contact.

Intuitive Feedback: The system uses both haptic feedback (vibration) for obstacles and audible alerts (buzzer) for emergencies, providing clear and distinct warnings.

Rechargeable Power System: Powered by a standard 3.7V 18650 Li-ion battery, featuring a TP4056 module for safe and easy charging via a standard USB port.
